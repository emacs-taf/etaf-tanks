;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1") (etaf "0.3.0") (etaf-gamekit "0.1.0") (etaf-ui "0.1.0"))
;;; Commentary:
;; This game follows the rules of the 1985 arcade tank battle: defend the
;; eagle base at the bottom of the field, destroy every enemy tank of the
;; stage, and lose when the base falls or the last life is gone.  A headless
;; Godot world owns the rules, a fixed simulation clock and the renderer,
;; which draws flat vector art with soft lighting at the display's own
;; resolution; ETAF shows the changed lines of each frame, the stage select,
;; the battle HUD, the map editor and the settings.  Text frames get an
;; equivalent character grid.  The twenty stages and all art are original.
;;
;; Enemies are basic, fast, power (fast shells) and armored (four hits)
;; tanks; flashing carriers drop helmet, clock, shovel, star, grenade and
;; extra-tank bonuses.  Difficulty and the stage number raise enemy count on
;; the field, spawn rate, firing rate and armored upgrades.
;;
;; Maps are UTF-8 text files: an optional `name:' line, `enemies: B F P A'
;; (basic, fast, power and armored counts, 1-60 in total) and a `map:'
;; section of equal rows, 12-52 columns by 12-40 rows, where each character
;; is one quarter of a tank: . ground, # brick, @ steel, ~ water, * forest,
;; = ice, and 2x2 groups of H (the base), P (player start) and E (one to
;; four enemy spawns).  Lines starting with ; are comments.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-game
;; Inert game definition usable with etaf-gamekit-start. The bundled Godot
;; project is resolved from this application entry, not from GameKit. Each
;; instance owns an independent battlefield.  Its operations (begin, pause,
;; drive, fire, save, load and others) and its observation are described in
;; docs/manual.md under programmatic callers.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-appearance
;; Initial appearance of new instances: auto (default), light or dark. Auto
;; follows the opening frame's background mode. Each instance switches
;; independently with T or the settings without resetting the battle.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-difficulty
;; Initial difficulty: easy (five lives, fewer and slower enemies), normal
;; (default) or hard (more enemies on the field, faster fire, more armor).
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-game-speed
;; Simulation speed factor from 0.5 to 2.0 (default 1.0) for every tank,
;; shell and timer.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-tank-speed
;; Speed factor from 0.5 to 2.0 (default 1.0) of the player's tank only.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-sensitivity
;; How long the tank keeps driving after an arrow key event: auto (default)
;; derives it from the system key repeat on macOS and otherwise uses
;; standard; sensitive stops sooner; smooth bridges slower repeats.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-drive-mode
;; hold (default) drives while an arrow is held; latch keeps driving after
;; one press, follows later arrows and stops only with X or Shift+arrow.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-frame-rate
;; Battlefield frames per second on graphic displays: 30 (default) or 60.
;; The simulation clock is unaffected, and frames answering drive, aim, fire
;; or pause keys are drawn on the next simulation step at either rate.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-board-size
;; Preferred battlefield block size on graphic displays: small, medium
;; (default) or large, 12, 16 or 20 pixels per block.  A window too small
;; for the preference uses smaller blocks, down to 10 pixels, then clips.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-map-directory
;; Directory listed under the custom tab and used to save edited maps.
;;
;; Variable: etaf-tanks-progress-file
;; File remembering cleared stages and best scores per difficulty.
;;
;; Function: etaf-tanks-create ()
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-tanks-create "etaf-tanks" nil t)
;; Create and return an independent GameKit session without displaying it. The
;; caller owns display and lifecycle; pass the result to etaf-tanks-view and
;; release it with etaf-gamekit-close.
;;
;; Function: etaf-tanks-view (session)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-tanks-view "etaf-tanks" nil t)
;; Return the reactive View for SESSION, suitable for embedding in a host such
;; as an etaf-desktop window. The caller owns SESSION's display and lifecycle.
;; Leaving its focus subtree pauses a running battle without resetting it;
;; reentry does not resume. Delayed screen updates do not reclaim host focus.
;;
;; Function: etaf-tanks-doctor ()
;; Return capability facts for playing tanks.  The shape matches
;; `etaf-install-doctor': the simulation host and its rules come from
;; `etaf-gamekit', which is an ordinary package dependency, while the Godot
;; runtime is a local build that must be detected before a battle can start.
;;
;; Function: etaf-tanks-open ()
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-tanks-open "etaf-tanks" nil t)
;; Start and display an independent instance at the stage select; return its
;; GameKit instance. Requires Godot installed by GameKit. Arrows choose a
;; stage and Return starts it; in battle arrows drive, Shift+arrows turn in
;; place, F fires and P pauses.  ? / F1 and the help button share searchable
;; modal help inside the game buffer.  Opening help pauses a running battle;
;; closing it restores focus without resuming.  Battles are saved and
;; loaded only through explicit paths (C-s and C-o); a restore validates the
;; snapshot, resumes paused and clears in-flight shells and spawns.
;;
;; Function: etaf-tanks-close (&optional instance)
;;;###autoload (autoload 'etaf-tanks-close "etaf-tanks" nil t)
;; Close INSTANCE and its buffer. Omitted uses the current tank battle buffer.
;; No automatic save is performed; campaign progress is already recorded.
